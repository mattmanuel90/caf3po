### Caf3po
A rewrite/revival of our CAF hackathon slackbot in 2016. It lives on!

Caf3po will summarise:
* Your current open tasks/tickets on Zendesk/Jira
* Your activity yesterday on Jira
* Messages you have sent to on slack channels

Useful for morning daily standups with the midweek hangover and also if your lazy with timesheets.

Ideally you want the bot to message you every morning during the week.
